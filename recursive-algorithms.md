## Credits
These algorithm implementations are practice problems I have largely collected from Jeff Erickson's book, Algorithms. Throughout my time in University, although we were often tasked to develop algorithms, I realized I had no idea how to implement any of them in any useful or meaningful way. This page documents my progress practicing full scale algorithm integration from synthesis to implementation.
