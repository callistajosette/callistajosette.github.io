## Projects
### LOCKDOWN: A Security Analysis of the 4th-Generation August WiFi Smart Lock

We explored various security components of the 4th generation August smart lock. Notably, we identified that August’s choice to integrate with services like Airbnb made more viable a less-studied form of threat model – the Airbnb attacker – under which new classes of attacks were possible. Under this threat model, we identified two types of attacks that give an attacker persistent control of the lock: one that prevents the lock owner from deprovisioning the attacker’s guest access, and another that leverages several lock hardware vulnerabilities.
