## Description

A recurrence is a recursive description of a function, or in other words, a description of a function in terms of itself. Like all recursive structures, a recurrence consists of one or more base cases and one or more recursive cases. We say that a particular function satisfies a reucrrence, or is the solution to a recurrence if each of the statements of a recurrence holds. For bounds analysis, we desire a closed-form, non-recurisve solution to problems.
